                    <p>As artificial intelligence continues to advance, particularly in the realm of generative AI, we
                        face unprecedented challenges in distinguishing between authentic human-created content and
                        AI-generated content. These challenges extend across multiple domains, from identity
                        verification to content authentication and trust in digital interactions.</p>

                    <p>The ability of AI to generate increasingly realistic and convincing fake content threatens the
                        foundation of trust in digital communications and transactions. This section explores the key
